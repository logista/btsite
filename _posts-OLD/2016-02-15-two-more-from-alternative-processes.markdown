These two prints are showing on extended loan to Washtenaw Community College. I'm really pleased!

See [this post](/a-new-gallery/) for their classmates. I've also added them to the [Alternative Processes Gallery](/gallery-altpro/).

After the passing of time, I can see all the flaws in the Tri-color Gum, but I'm still pretty darn pleased with the Calla Lith. ðŸ˜„
