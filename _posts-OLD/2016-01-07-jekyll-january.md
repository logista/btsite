I've updated `Jekyll` to 3.x. `Jekyll` changed quite a bit of its underlying code, but mostly it was in areas that didn't affect my site. The one exception: they changed the syntax highlighting library from `pygments` to `rouge`, which *did* require me to make a few tweaks to my `css`. I'm not entirely sure why, but it could have something to do with how I use `kramdown` _vs._ `liquid` tags.

If you see any problems, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/logista/btsite2015/issues) at my github page.
