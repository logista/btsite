I suppose I've arrived at that place many graduated (or simply ex-) students reach once they're no longer in school: I'm finding it difficult to *finish* pieces without having that external push. I have several ongoing projects that just aren't coming together, and others that require resources I don't have. It's discouraging sometimes, to think of everything I haven't done.[^hami] However, I am constantly photographing [_stuff_](http://www.ebay.com/usr/cornersbumped) [^ebay], and sometimes I turn an image of an item into something more interesting and less prosaic.

[^ebay]: I photograph the things that aren't books

[^hami]: Now I've got [_Hamilton!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIl1OIGzuDg) in my head of course

For example:

<figure class="image-s">
  <a href="/images/posts/l/2017-03-21-barbara-tozier-honor_maid_nightscape.jpg" title="Honor Maid Night">
    <img src="/images/posts/s/2017-03-21-barbara-tozier-honor_maid_nightscape.jpg">
  </a>
  <a href="/images/posts/l/2017-03-22-barbara-tozier-arcoroc_france.jpg" title="Arcoroc France">
    <img src="/images/posts/s/2017-03-22-barbara-tozier-arcoroc_france.jpg">
  </a>
    <span class="image-s-caption">Click image to see larger</span>
</figure>

I really like these images and their spontaneous creation. They're like a painter's sketches or an illustrator's doodles. They remind me that I can still experiment with image making without dragging out chemicals or doing a lot of hand work. They are quick and remind me that creativity and inspiration are everywhere in everyone.

I have more --- I've been sharing them on [my Tumblr](http://logista.tumblr.com), perhaps it is time make a home for them here.
