I suppose I've arrived at that place many graduated (or simply ex-) students reach once they're no longer in school: I'm finding it difficult to *finish* pieces without having that external push. I have several ongoing projects that just aren't coming together, and others that require resources I don't have. It's discouraging sometimes, to think of everything I haven't done.[^hami] However, I am constantly photographing [_stuff_](http://www.ebay.com/usr/cornersbumped) [^ebay], and sometimes I turn an image of an item into something more interesting and less prosaic.

[^ebay]: I photograph the things that aren't books

[^hami]: Now I've got [_Hamilton!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIl1OIGzuDg) in my head of course

For example:

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20170321-btozier-honor-maid-nightscape.jpg"
  title="Honor Maid Night"
  alt="Amorphous shiny arcs of purples golds blues and aquas with some thin paths running through it all"
%}

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20170322-btozier-arcoroc-france.jpg"
  title="Arcoroc France"
  alt="Two gold arcs span the image; smooth white blobs fill in from the bottom. The top is black. Lettering is next to one of the arcs, it says 'Arcoroc France'"
  caption="A glass plate"
%}

I really like these images and their spontaneous creation. They're like a painter's sketches or an illustrator's doodles. They remind me that I can still experiment with image making without dragging out chemicals or doing a lot of hand work. They are quick and remind me that creativity and inspiration are everywhere in everyone.

I have more --- I've been sharing them on [my Tumblr](http://logista.tumblr.com), perhaps it is time make a home for them here.
