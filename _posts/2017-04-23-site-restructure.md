After taking weeks longer than I expected (*of course*) I've got my site back into a condition where I feel comfortable sharing it and writing new posts.[^really]

There have been some substantial changes, not the least of which is I've changed to [Bootstrap 4 alpha](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com). Now, normally using an "alpha" system for a production site is not a good idea, but it's been in development for a couple of years --- they have some work to do, but for what I'm using it seems to be stable.

The home page the place for new content --- if I make a new [project gallery](/portfolio/) it will automagically show up on the front page, like posts currently do. This was both easier and harder than I thought it would be. Without going into detail, let me just say that I'm happy my husband has some experience with Ruby.[^detail]

I've also cleaned up some of the code around the project gallery pages so that I can talk about the images actually on the page, rather than in a separate place. There've been improvements with the archive page, too.

However, the biggest change has been with how I deal with images back here on my desktop computer. Because of that, some old posts have been removed that talked about how I used to do it. I hope to have a post about the new system soon, not because I'm any sort of expert, but because I've been helped by *other* people talking about how they do stuff, and I'd like to pay it back.

Overall, I've tried to make the site responsive and clean, but I know there are flaws. If there is something that doesn't seem to work, please contact me or leave an issue at [github](https://github.com/logista/btsite).

[^detail]: If you're interested, the code underlying this site is at [github](https://github.com/logista/btsite).

[^really]: Actually, if I don't upload it, I will end up making minor changes to everything until winter.
