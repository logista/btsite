I was [recently named](http://ums.org/2016/09/14/announcing-2016-17-ums-artists-in-residence/) a University Musical Society Artist in Residence for the 2016-2017 season. I'll have more to say about this exciting news later, but right now I want to share some images from the first [Renegade](http://ums.org/series/renegade/) performance of the season: [_Falling Up and Getting Down_](http://ums.org/performance/falling-up-and-getting-down/) which was a improvisation between live jazz and pro skateboarders.

On the beautiful September afternoon, I took along Stubbie (my Holga[^holga]) to make some images.

I don't normally photograph people, nor do I photograph action.[^still] I used Stubbie because of the feeling of "letting go" that I get from using it. If I'd taken a digital camera, or a film camera with standard controls, I would have spent much of my time trying to figure out the right settings to get *perfect* images. With Stubbie I was able to enjoy the performances of the musicians and the skaters, as well as make a few images that I'm happy with.

One more thing: these images show lots of processing "flaws" but really, that's just a thing that happens when you're using 15-year-old film. I'm learning in my art-making journey that the pursuit of perfection is sometimes an excuse for not even trying something. In the end, this is the lesson behind _Falling Up and Getting Down_ --- improvisation means working with what you have available to you in the moment, and even if it's unexpected, it can still be pretty darned cool.

[^still]: Still lifes don't move very much, and you don't have to worry if they're tired or hungry, and if something doesn't quite work out you can always make another exposure.

[^holga]: Holga is a "toy" camera --- plastic lens, limited controls, medium format.
