I'm taking an introductory film photography class this term for a few reasons. One, I like the instructor; two, I want more darkroom time; three, I like seeing how "new" photographers deal with the concepts that are so familiar to me (depth of field, the exposure triangle, etc.). If I *do* go to art school, Introduction to Photography is likely a class I would teach. Getting a lot of early-level experience is really helpful to knowing where people trip up.[^ta]

[^ta]: I don't get quite the same view as a teaching assistant for the class (having done it a few times), because I don't attend the lectures or the critiques so my assistance is limited to technical issues in the darkroom.

However, since I'm *in* the class (and taking it for credit) I, uh, actually need to do the work. I'm finding this more difficult than I expected, mainly because I'm trying to make pictures that meet the assignment that are also *interesting* pictures.

The current assignment is "Motion" --- stop motion, slowed motion, panning... stuff that's all pretty easy to accomplish if the weather is decent, and is a pain to do if you're stuck inside. Like I have been for the past week.. and need to have a roll to develop tomorrow...

I was trying all sorts of things: bean pours (like a [beer pour](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+pour&tbm=isch), but with beans), fake waterfalls, bouncing balls... and nothing was working. Either I wasn't able to make an interesting composition or I didn't have the right sort of light to get the effect I wanted. In the end, I turned to my old friend Slinky.

Slinky is a wonderful subject --- it can move, it can be still, it can look super abstract, and often all in the same image. The pictures here are digital; I'm hoping I have similar (or better!) ones on film.[^spend]

I suppose I'll find out this week! 😉

[^spend]: One thing I love about current-day photography is that I can make all sorts of test images before I "spend" my film.
