I mentioned in [Inspiration: Glass](/inspiration-glass) that I really enjoy photographing glass. Here are a few examples:

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20160819-btozier-red-bottle.jpg"
  title="Bottle"
  alt="A red bottle that is thick in the middle and nips to a small opening and neck. The base is clear glass and the red color rounds into it. White background."
  caption="Hefty"
%}

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20160710-btozier-vase.jpg"
  title="Vase"
  alt="A slender lime green vase with clear footed base stands on a blue table with a dark background. It is flared on the top and curves in at the middle."
  caption="Elegant curves"
%}
{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20160820-btozier-cruet.jpg"
  title="Cruet"
  alt="Aqua two-chambered vase, bulbous like a flower. Lots of glass bubbles."
  caption="Too pretty for vinegar"
%}

These are simple settings, but it probably that it seems that way to me because I've photographed a lot of glass.[^ebay] I find that the objects are beautiful, and I try to share that.

Not that I intend to ever create in glass myself. I've worked around high-temperature furnaces (in a previous life) and it's not something I care to do more of. I do, however, appreciate people who do glass art. It's a fascinating medium.


[^ebay]: We have an [eBay store](http://www.ebay.com/sch/cornersbumped/m.html) where we sell collectibles and books. Most of the not-books are photographed by me, which is a great way to get familiar with product photography.
