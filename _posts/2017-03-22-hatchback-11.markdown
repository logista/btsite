I'm pleased to share that I will be participating in [Hatchback 11](http://www.hatchart.org/hatchartnews/2017/3/21/hatchback-11-april-1-april-28-2017), an annual all-media show at [Hatch Art Center](http://www.hatchart.org) in Hamtramck. This year's edition was juried by Treena Flannery Ericson, Gallery Director of [The Scarab Club](http://scarabclub.org).

The show opens on Saturday, April 1 (6-10 pm). I'm sad that I can't make the opening, but I hope to attend an artist talk on a subsequent Saturday (2pm April 8, 22, 28).

TODO: My piece, _Bowl_, will be hung ... ?? ...

_Bowl_ is a unique silver-gelatin 10" × 8" photographic print. I made it by enlarging a 4" × 5" negative onto 8" × 10" paper and exposing it normally. Then I painted the developer onto the paper; once it looked "ready" I rinsed the print and then took it out into daylight. This process, which I've called "[idlograph](/idlographs/)" introduces color into a nominally black-and-white image. Once the color looked "ready", I fixed the image and finished as normal.

And then I looked more at the print, and decided it needed something more. What can you do with a "finished" print? You can bleach it and redevelop it! Most commonly identified with sepia toning, there are other chemistries that one can use on a print. In this case, I used a copper sulfate bleach, and then used lith chemistry to redevelop the silver. This added coppery highlights to the image, which I liked with the warm brown of the paper.

*Now* it's finished and you can see it in person in Hamtramck.
