My [(in)decision](/new-catalog-or-not/) on a new Lightroom catalog has been made irrelevant by the fact that I've run out of hard drive space. I've been using a convoluted backup "strategy" that resulted in multiple copies of files with multiple backups on multiple drives. From one perspective, this is good, because barring a catastrophe I will always have at least one copy that is valid. In reality, though, I can't find anything, I don't know which file is the "right" one, and I'm out of storage space. I could just go buy another drive, but that is only a technical solution to what is a systemic problem.

Over the past week I've been thinking about how best to organize my stuff for the future, and reconsidering decisions I made about all of my old stuff.

Part of the problem is history. I have personal digital photos in iPhoto, Aperture, Lightroom, and in scattered folders. I have scans of family slides, negatives, and scrapbooks in a separate system. I have some client work that is self-contained. I have an [ongoing project](http://resart.us) that is completely computer-based and part of my Art Practice[^practice], but isn't (seemingly) connected to my other work though it could be.[^physical]

[^practice]: *Pretentious much?*

[^physical]: None of this has anything to do with the physical objects. That's a *nightmare*.

Here is what I'm working toward:

* Non-client (digital and scanned film) photographs go into one master catalog
* Client photographs each get their own catalog
* Family images (I have *decades* of slides still to scan) get their own catalog
* _Resartus_ gets its own catalog
* School gets its own catalog (this catalog lives on a portable drive)

This is still separated quite a bit, but it gives me some smaller chunks that can be more easily moved to an archive drive to save active space.

I will also change how I actually handle the new images on import. I use a program called [_Ingestamatic_](http://basepath.com/site/detail-Ingestamatic.php) that names the files based on some EXIF data and then puts a copy in my "negatives" file and puts another copy for Lightroom to see. Previously, when I imported to Lightroom I would make a DNG *copy* from the 2nd copy.[^count] I don't mind making a DNG, but it has finally occurred to me that I don't need to make a copy of the 2nd copy, I just need to *move* the 2nd copy into my Lightroom catalog (converting on the way).[^dng]

I can't just delete the existing "2nd" copies because some of them are directly referenced by various catalogs. OOOPS.

[^count]: If you're counting, that's three copies, and that's before backing up.

[^dng]: Debating the merits of Adobe DNG is boring. Don't go there.

So now that I know where I want to be (and how I will do it going forward), how do I get there? As far as I can tell, it's going to be a combination of tedium and terror, with a bit of nostalgia thrown in for good measure. Some of these images I haven't seen *for years*, including many photos of loved ones now deceased. I think, however, I will work backward through time.

* First, consolidate all of my non-client non-school non-family Lightroom catalogs. Lightroom has a [mechanism for this](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/help/import-photos-various-sources.html#import_photos_from_a_different_lightroom_catalog), and I believe I can merge catalogs without losing any Lightroom edits (no matter where the edit took place).

* Then, get my Aperture & iPhoto libraries in shape to use the Lightroom [Aperture import plug-in](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/aperture-import-plug-in-lightroom-faq.html)[^photos] to add them to my catalog. I also need to consider what to do with PhotoBooth photos and movies.

[^photos]: I've never intentionally opened Apple's _Photos_ app, but I may have to in order to prepare the older files.

* In the meantime, make sure I'm not triple-dipping on the _Resartus_ catalog, the Family Scans catalog, and the School catalog.

* Oh, I need to get that off-site backup thing going, too.

* Finally, rearchive the new stuff and *delete all of the old stuff*. (See? *Terror*)

I need to get this done, because I need to make some photos before I go batty. Wish me luck.
