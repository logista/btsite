Since I call myself a photographer, I suppose I should try to include some images in my posts. I expect that *future* posts will have some technical and/or theoretical stuff related to photography (especially as I get into my coursework at the end of the month *eek!*) but to test that this new system works (for some undefined definition of that word...)

Here's an image that I like:

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20150802-btozier-square-orange-texture.jpg"
  title="Orange Texture"
  alt="square image with orange, gold, and brown mottled colors"
  caption="Orange Texture"
%}

Here are two together:

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20150726-btozier-orange-texture.jpg"
  title="Orange Fabric"
  alt="close up of velvety orange fabric"
  caption="Orange Fabric"
%}

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20150803-btozier-sun-texture.jpg"
  title="Sun Texture"
  alt="bluish-black and white criss-cross pattern in a triangular shape"
  caption="Sun Texture"
%}


Ok. Seems... ok anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯[^1]

Not entirely sure of the decoration and spacing, but it'll do for now.

[^1]:Wow, what I had to do to that to get kramdown to render it right. `¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯`
