Since I call myself a photographer, I suppose I should try to include some images in my posts. I expect that *future* posts will have some technical and/or theoretical stuff related to photography (especially as I get into my coursework at the end of the month *eek!*) but to test that this new system works (for some undefined definition of that word...)

Here's an image that I like:

[![Orange Texture](/images/posts/s/2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-square-orange-texture.jpg)](/images/posts/l/2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-square-orange-texture.jpg "Orange Texture")
{: .figure}

Here are two together:

[![Orange Fabric](/images/posts/s/2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-orange-texture.jpg)](/images/posts/l/2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-orange-texture.jpg "Orange Fabric")
[![Sun Texture](/images/posts/s/2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-sun-texture.jpg)](/images/posts/l/2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-sun-texture.jpg "Sun Texture")
{: .figure .half}


Ok. Seems... ok anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯[^1]

Not entirely sure of the decoration and spacing, but it'll do for now.

[^1]:Wow, what I had to do to that to get kramdown to render it right. `¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯`
