I'm still trying to figure out a workflow for writing-related ad hoc images. (Or, _ad hoc_ if you listen to some people in the house.)

So far it's rather fiddly, involving exporting twice from Lightroom, then verifying file names, then moving into my site's images folder. I'm sure I could do some sort of "Lightroom Publish" thing, but until I can trust the filenames will be accurate...

I also realized after the [Textures](/textures-for-fun/) post, I need to make certain I have smallish images, otherwise they overwhelm my [RSS feed](http://barbaratozier.com/feed.xml), for instance, let alone any mobile device.

All that to share this image:

{% include _figures.html
  base_image_filename="20150804-btozier-evening-shadow.jpg"
  title="Evening Shadow"
  alt="beige and dark blue-to-black abstract triangles"
  caption="Evening in the studio"
%}


Enjoy it, and expect to see more oddly-sized images in the future.
