[Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt "Wikipedia entry") was a minimalist conceptual artist. He work is influenced by combinatorics, and completion, and counting, and geometry. He typically would write out the "program" for the draftsman or photographer or welder to complete --- such as in his Wall Drawings. In 2013, I came across a description of Sol LeWitt's _Five Cubes on Twenty-five Squares with Either Sides or Corners Touching_, and it appealed to my analytical side. The description 

_After LeWitt, Part 1: Diverse_ is not the piece I started to make.
