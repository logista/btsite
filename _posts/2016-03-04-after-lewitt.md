[Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt "Wikipedia entry") was a minimalist conceptual artist. He work is influenced by combinatorics, and completion, and counting, and geometry. He typically would write out the "program" for the draftsman or photographer or welder to complete --- such as in his Wall Drawings. In 2013, I came across a description[^description] of Sol LeWitt's _Five Cubes on Twenty-five Squares with Either Sides or Corners Touching_.[^book] I thought that it would be an interesting exercise --- could I make a series of photographs that enumerated all of the arrangements of five cubes on twenty-five squares with corners touching?



[^description]: > Five Cubes/Twenty-five Squares (Corners Touching). 1977. Plastic (also steel), each cube 6x6x6 in; base 1x 33x33 in. All combinations of five cubes on a five-by-five square base that touch one another at least on one corner. Two versions, one steel, one plastic, and a book to show all variations (251 possibilities).

[^book]: I can't remember right now... I found it at the WCC library.

_After LeWitt, Part 1: Diverse_ is not the piece I started to make.
