I am delighted to announce that two of my images from [_In Camera_](/galleries/in-camera/) are going to be at the [Somerville Toy Camera Festival](http://www.somervilletoycamera.org). This is my first time applying to a show outside of my local area, and I'm ecstatic that my work was accepted.

The juror is [Christopher James](http://www.christopherjames-studio.com) who wrote [**the** book](http://www.christopherjames-studio.com/build/thebook.html) on Alternative Photographic Processes, so I'm feeling just a little bit geeked out about the whole thing.

Even more exciting for me is that one of my images is featured on the website for the show. Having this boost has just kept me smiling all summer.

The festival runs through most of September into October. My work will be shown at the [Washington Street Gallery](http://www.washingtonst.org), opening Saturday, September 10 from 7-10. I'm bummed that I can't be there, because it looks like the whole show is going to be pretty cool.

If you are at all intrigued by what people can *do* with "toy" cameras, I encourage you to visit. You might even find inspiration to pick up a "toy" for yourself.
