In the summer I got a bright shiny new iPhone 7+ to replace my aging (and damaged) iPhone 4S. The difference in size took me all of about a week to get used to --- my old phone seems so tiny now! --- and it's super cool that I can play PokémonGO again.

I can also make pictures, of course, and experimented a bit like you do when you get a new camera.

These were taken at [Oak Openings Metropark](https://metroparkstoledo.com/explore-your-parks/oak-openings/) near Toledo, Ohio. It's a lovely park with forests, sand dunes, lakes, and some nice trails. It's wonderful in the summer (we were there in August), and if I was more of an outdoorsy person I'd probably like it in the winter, too.

I've been making photos with my new phone since I got it, but I have a problem with getting the photos off of my phone to share on my site here. With my old phone I would regularly offload the photos (since it didn't have much storage space) and import them into my Lightroom catalog. With this new phone, I have tons of storage space linked to my iCloud photos which I can see and store on my iMac in my Photos app, so in theory I would not have to frequently offload my images.

So now I don't have a _capacity_ issue, but I do have a workflow problem. The pictures for this site are managed by my Lightroom catalog. The [desktop version](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) of Lightroom[^mob] doesn't handle the [Apple HEIF image format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format), and I don't want to have edited photos in two places.

I've worked around that so far by ignoring the problem. But I have made some photos for a couple of ongoing projects that *should* be shared here and I can't because I'm waiting for Adobe to support HEIF in their desktop app.[^lrmob] So in the meantime I do other stuff and try to find other ways to share images I make on my phone. One day I'll figure this part out.

It *also* doesn't help the workflow problem that I also got a new computer[^updates], but it makes it so much nicer to work with images now :)


[^mob]: They support in in their Mobile app, but I don't use it.
[^lrmob]: No really, the mobile app *really* doesn't fit my workflow.
[^updates]: SO MANY APPS TO UPDATE
