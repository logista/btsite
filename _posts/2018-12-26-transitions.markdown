I'm giving up.

I'm doing this because I need to clear away stuff that has been hanging over me and taking up mental capacity that I don't have right now. Depression is a hard thing to talk about; there are many people who have written much more eloquently about how it has affected their lives and their work, so I'm not going to reiterate.

Once upon a time I thought that I would do art (maybe even Art). I am not as good at self-study and self-direction as I thought. I have been flitting about trying different types of processes, and they're getting ever stranger and ever cheaper because I haven't got money to invest in decent materials or space to work or time to think.

I thought I would make money selling prints.

I thought I would make money photographing things.

These things haven't happened. I don't do self-promotion well, and my confidence in my own abilities is pretty much non-existent at the moment.

I am eternally grateful to the people who *have* bought things from me; I sometimes wonder why they did.

And yet, here I am, trying to sell work in probably the worst way possible. However, these prints were done when I was confident in and comfortable with my work, and I still really like these pieces.

So here it is, the end of 2018, and before I close up my [Square Shop](https://squareup.com/store/barbara-tozier) for good (the end of January 2019), I'm offering limited edition prints[^editions] with discount code `GOODBYE25`; free shipping and Michigan sales tax included. If you saw something on my site that interested you that's not on the Square store, contact me (links at the bottom of the page) and maybe we can come to an arrangement.

I don't know what I'm going to do with this site. Maybe I'll put up something that I've been working on without worrying if they're finished enough or good enough or interesting enough. Maybe that will be enough.


[^editions]: I [stopped working in editions](/on-editions/), and will never reprint these images. The prints I'm offering were never made in a full edition. I was optimistic, I guess.
