I've posted a [new gallery](/gallery-altpro/) on alternative processes. This was a from class I took in the first part of the year, which was a survey of as many "alternative processes" as we could dream up. Pinhole images, anthotypes, silkscreen printing, transfers of every kind, toning... No, really, it was fantastic. I found many ways to create images, and I was surprised in the end with what most resonated with me.

Here's what I wrote just after the class ended:

> Of all the processes I attempted, I most enjoyed doing the lith darkroom prints (this really surprised me, as I didn’t expect to even try this one because darkroom). My second favorite was doing gum bichromate. Tied for third are the inkjet transfers and the fuji manipulations. I really like the feeling of not-being-totally in control.

I'm considering doing some AltPro for my Projects class this fall. We'll see...

The gallery doesn't include (at the moment) two images that are waiting to be displayed in the WCC showcase -- a lith print and a multi-color gum bichromate.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to figure out how to show the processes involved in each picture in the AltPro gallery, so I'll leave them here for you. To see larger versions, [visit the gallery](/gallery-altpro/).
