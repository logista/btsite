This is probably my favorite 28 seconds in any movie, ever. I only wish it lasted another couple of beats to get the full development of Broadbent's emotion.

In case you're not familiar with _Topsy-Turvy_, it's a story of the creation of _The Mikado_ by WS Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Frankly, that's pretty much the only thing I remember about the film, short of this little clip which affected me so much when I saw it on the big screen at the Michigan Theater more than a decade(!) ago.

Immediately before this clip, Gilbert is in the throes of writer's block and wandering around his study in his dressing gown, playing with a sword. He sets the sword down, then looks at it and inspiration (for the Orientalist _Mikado_) arrives.

This is how inspiration works sometimes. You mull, you play, you test, you try, you throw away... and all the time you are still *doing the thing*, you are still *working*, you are still *making art* whether or not it is something that will become the so-called "final" piece.

When inspiration happens, you'll make that face. I know that I do.
