Each summer I revamp my website because I realize I haven't touched it for nearly a year. A couple of years ago it was pretty much a one-page brochure site; last year it was a portfolio site that I made before I exhibited at [The Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, The Original][aadf90bf]. I had planned to add a section for writing (I hesitate to call it a blog, because *blog* implies some sort of best-by date) but it never materialized.

This year's effort will be (I hope) easier to manage and easier to maintain. I've converted to [Jekyll][fd5abaf8], which requires a bit of tech-savvy to work with, but not more than I have. The advantage to Jekyll is that I can create the site on my desktop and then upload the finished site to my web host ([Pair][195ed5c6]) without having to have a database setup.

I'm still developing (heh, I meant that) a workflow, but so far it has 4 components:

  1. [Lightroom][c0e05cda] exports pictures to specific folders for the galleries
  2. [Atom][01d53a70] to write posts and manage the Jekyll system
  3. [Transmit][21ab70d2] to upload
  4. [GitHub][5f921b61] to manage versions of the website

Each of these components has its issues, but I think that as long as I keep at it, I will manage.

Wish me luck!
