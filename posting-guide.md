Most "posts" are going to be text-related with or without photographs.

I am unclear on what needs quote marks (either double or single) and what doesn't. As far as I can tell, YAML doesn't care. The important part is for the Jekyll parser to understand it. I'm writing this little file to remind myself to be consistent.

## YAML headers

### Text posts

Here's a big yaml header for a text-only post:

~~~ yaml
---
layout: post
title: "YANS"
excerpt: "Another summer, another new website"
tags: [self-referential, website, workflow]
date: 2015-08-01
modified: 2015-08-04
---
~~~

**IT IS REQUIRED** to include `layout:`. I could set a `default` in Jekyll, but I want to get used to adding it (in the event I make a different layout for images, for instance), so I won't. Since this is only ever used internally, it doesn't need quote marks.

**IT IS REQUIRED** to include `title:`. Double quotes around the title, no matter how short. If using quote marks *within* the title, be sure to use `'single quotes'`.

**IT IS REQUIRED** to include an excerpt, because I don't like/trust Jekyll to do it the way I want. Mostly this can be the first sentence of the first paragraph, or a super-brief logline for the post. Syntax similar to `title:`

`tags:` are not required, they're only used in the HTML header for SEO purposes, as if that mattered. They are a comma-delimited list, inside of brackets. `Two or more word items` do not seem to need quotes.

**IT IS REQUIRED** to date the post, because Jekyll will always default to the filename and I hope one day that we won't have to have filenames with dates in them.  Since I don't expect to post more than once a day, setting `date:` to the day level (without a time) should be enough. If I get antsy, I can always add the time in ad hoc.

`modified:` is only for a "big enough" change. Minor typo changes (and the stuff associated with revamping the YAML frontmatter) doesn't get it.



### Image posts

~~~ yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Textures for Fun"
excerpt: "Since I call myself a photographer, I suppose I should try to include some images in my posts."
tags: [photograph, texture, orange, gray]
date: 2015-08-03
modified: 2015-08-04
ogimage: '/images/posts/s/2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-square-orange-texture.jpg'
---
~~~

For now, I'm using the same layout for text-based and picture-based (and quote-based) posts. This may change, because I'm currently having to do lots of extra stuff to get images into a post. This includes creating a thumbnail for an image so too-large images don't overwhelm my RSS feed. This doesn't have a good resolution yet --- I need to make some more posts with images to get a feel for how I want to work with them in the future.

(added later:)

Images for posts are separated by size/type. `images/posts/s` is "small" or thumbnail sized, approximately 300px on the longest dimension. `images/posts/m` is "medium" sized, about 600px on the longest dimension. `images/posts/l` is "large" sized, 12-1500 px on the longest dimension. These should only ever be linked to in a post from one of the smaller versions, so the slideshow can pick it up. I'm currently (2015-08-11) thinking that only `s` images link to `l` versions, while `m` are standalones.

I've also added a 4th folder called `images/posts/ss`. This is for one-off screenshots.

This feels a little fiddly, but for now I'm going for it.

(added later:)

To get a nice "social media" promotable image, use the YAML `ogimage:` tag. Pick one of the images on the page and include the full URL.

### Pages

~~~ yaml
---
layout: gallerypage
gallery: gallery-stories
title: "Stories"
excerpt: "Words and pictures, pictures and words."
tags: [photograph, abstract, color, digital, fine art, close up, books, stories]
date: 2015-08-01
---
~~~

Most Pages are galleries. However, the "no quotes" thing seems to be suitable. Follow the guidelines from above.

`date:` isn't used in Jekyll with Pages, but I now realize it might be a good thing to have for keeping track of when things have been changed. So I'm including it.

The images in the galleries are 300px thumbnails, linking to a larger (1500px) copy used for the slideshow. They are listed in `_data/gallerylist.yml` in the order they are to appear on the page. A single "feature" image is also noted --- this is the image used to represent the gallery on the Portfolio Index page.


## Special CSS classes

### images

#### screen captures

The `<figure>` element is used with `.image-ss` to style (small) screenshot images. It will put them in their own block in the center of the text where they appear. It can be styled further within the `<figure>` element.

I have made some Atom.snippets to help me remember this stuff. For example, typing `ssfm` and then `tab` *should* expand to

~~~ html

<figure class="image-ss">
 <img src="/images/posts/ss/~tab to here~.jpg">
</figure>

~tab again to start typing here~
~~~

#### small-sized images (linked to larger)

- The `<figure>` element is used with `.image-s` to style small-sized "digital works" images. Up to two small images can be placed within one `<figure>` element block. If the images link to a larger image (the most common mode), then a caption `<span class="image-s-caption">Click image to see larger</span>` should be placed within `<figcaption>` markup.

Typing `sfm1` and then `tab` will put one image in a single figure markup with a link to the larger size, like:

~~~ html
<figure class="image-s">
  <a href="/images/posts/l/~tab 1 to here~.jpg" title="~tab 2 here~">
    <img src="/images/posts/s/~copies filename above~.jpg">
  </a>
    <span class="image-s-caption">Click image to see larger</span>
</figure>

~tab again to start typing here~
~~~

To put two small images in the same figure, type `sfm2` and then `tab`

~~~ html
<figure class="image-s">
  <a href="/images/posts/l/~tab 1 to here~.jpg" title="~tab 2 here~">
    <img src="/images/posts/s/~copies filename 1~.jpg">
  </a>
  <a href="/images/posts/l/~tab 3 here~.jpg" title="~tab 4 here~">
    <img src="/images/posts/s/~copies filename 2~.jpg">
  </a>
    <span class="image-s-caption">Click image to see larger</span>
</figure>

~tab 5 to start typing here~
~~~


#### medium-sized images

The `<figure>` element is used with `.image-m-x` to style medium-sized "digital works" images. It will put the image in its own block in the center of the text. The `<figcaption>` markup is for the name (or other comment) on the image. If you want to use markdown, you need to enclose the text in a `<span markdown='1'>_styled_ text</span>`.

To (I hope) make it easier, type `mfm` and then `tab` to get:

~~~ html
<figure class="image-m-fig figure">
  <img class="image-m-img figure-img" src="/images/posts/m/~tab to here~.jpg">
  <figcaption class="image-m-cap figure-caption">~tab 2 goes here~</figcaption>
</figure>

~final tab goes here~
~~~

#### large-size images

- Large images do not (currently) have any particular styling outside of the slideshow.


### asides

Asides, while they are now an HTML5 element, are called using `{: .aside}` markup. Longer asides require div markup that starts something like `<div class="aside" markdown="1">`. They can appear anywhere within an article. They weren't styled by the original designer, and I may end up changing it later.

You know, now that I know how to make snippets, I've done it with `asdiv`:

~~~ html
<div class="aside" markdown="1">
~start writing~
</div>

~tab out~
~~~

This assumes that the aside isn't written yet. A similar snippet is for the kramdown markup: `asd` makes `{: .aside}` with some extra newlines.

### attention conservation notice

Goes at the top of longer articles. At the rate I'm going, it will go at the top of EVERY article ;) Called using `{: .acn}`, its snippet is `acn` (unsurprising)

### text box highlight

Sometimes I want a "code style" block to have wrapping. This was the way I managed to make it happen. It comes after the final tildes of a code block as `{: .text-highlight}`. Snippet `thb`.

### other dribs and drabs

`{: .code-snippet}` is a way to on occasion center a small bit of text --- code, usually. Its snippet code is `scs`.

### Video posts

There is an include (`_video-embed.html`) that will help put a YouTube video into a post. It's called from within the post. The YAML header should include a key-value pair of `youtubeId: yourvideoid`

~~~ HTML
{% include _video-embed.html id=page.youtubeId %}
~~~
