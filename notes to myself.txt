Noticing that many times the original designer chose "white" instead of "bodycolor"
Similar for "black" and "textcolor" or maybe it should be my emphasis color of "tozier-color" with some variations? (eh, no. Variations on Text Color)

Have since changed many instances of "bodycolor" back to "white" but then redefined "white" to "bodycolor". Ignoring the code syntax coloration for the moment.

Working out Bootstrap 4 grid breakpoints for the image `srcset` subproject...

If the post is in a `.container` and the browser window is wider than 1200px, then the maximum width of the `.container` is 1140px. No matter how big the screen, the widest the `.container` will be is 1140 pixels wide. This means I can limit my widest images to 1200 pixels wide. (I don't make images for desktop backgrounds.) This is a comfortable size for me, though it may mean my portrait oriented pictures are more than 1800 pixels tall. That is less comfortable...

**First Rule of Thumb:** No images larger than 1200px wide.

Right now, the post images are in a 9-column wide container (out of 12). So instead of 1140px maximum, it's really 1140*9/12, or 855 pixels will be the widest the image can get (in actual terms). So a 900px wide image would be enough in a page. A 1200px image would be more "future-proof" and would possibly look better in a slideshow/lightbox if I put one back in. But if I don't do that, then smaller is better.

**Second Rule of Thumb:** No images larger than 900px wide.

How do I want them to appear on the page? If I only do it "1-up" then they'd be centered, I guess. I haven't been doing much wrap-around with text stuff (none, really), but I often will put two "small" pictures next to each other.

But I just as frequently put a series of "medium" images after each other. So I don't think I need to get into `small` `medium` `large` for the purposes of *posting*, just for serving. I could be "mean" and just have the one large image for everything, but that feels wrong. I'm trying to do things ok, and learn stuff.

So, back to breakpoints, leaving post design philosophy for another time. By the way, the site looks TERRIBLE on my phone, so any changes I make need to be able to be easily redone, which is why I want to use Jekyll/Liquid partials to generate the `srcset` code.

I guess that's my goal for the next period.

2017-04-02

Looking through my existing image files, and I realize that I have a few that *weren't* generated from Lightroom (3 medium ones, to be exact 2015-09-01-simply-qee1f.jpg, 2015-12-22-iago-from-wikipedia.jpg, 2015-12-22-umma-cameron-musart_1975_1.63.jpg; and 2 screen captures) There are some knife pictures that may or may not be in my "Master LR" catalog, but that shouldn't be too hard...

I've put copies of them all in a "save" folder just in case...

So I can more-or-less clobber them and start over. Since I need to visit each post to update the image code, I might as well rename to something shorter. ;) I want to have my name in it, though, and at *least* the year. The title of the image gives it some uniqueness, but the filenames are getting too long.

Now that *that's* decided, now onto actual picture sizes.

I'm still thinking maximum width of 1200px for lightbox use. Offering 900px for large/wide screens? Then what about the smaller screens?

Let's look at the Bootstrap 4 breakpoints:

size    grid-bp     container-max    10/12g    10/12c
xs          0
sm        576           540            480      450
md        768           720            640      600
lg        992           960            827      800
xl       1200          1140           1000      950

So, because I don't expect to have a post layout larger than 10 columns wide (I like whitespace on the sides), I can see the maximum size for the page is 950px. This would handle xl and lg; 600 would handle sm and md, and 300 for everything else. And 1200 for display. 4 images. I can do that.

Using http://www.responsivebreakpoints.com

<img

src="2014-btozier-flowers-1200_e9p0vm_c_scale,w_680.jpg"
alt="">

LATER IN THE DAY. My wonderful husband wrote a small ruby plugin for me to auto resize images, and it's integrated into my jekyll! :) it's at github: `imageener` I can set the source folder, and as many different (fixed) widths as I want to upload. It will create the versions and put them in size-related folders in my `images/posts` folder. **I ONLY HAVE TO EXPORT ONE IMAGE FROM LIGHTROOM!!**

Now to get the post images regenerated, and the posts fixed, and the html `_include` written, and then go *back* to the main layout and fix it so it looks decent on the phone.

And then it's the portfolio/galleries. I should expect to do something similar with those images? Ah, but not today.

2017-04-03
MORE WITH `srcset` goldarnit. I have something that works (on my machine at least) more-or-less ok. I haven't regenerated the images yet. I'll do that after I get the lightbox in order.

To get it to work, I basically picked image-widths to go with the breakpoints in Bootstrap 4, and hardcoded the sizes in the `_figures.html` include. Then I messed about with the `main.scsss` to make a wider screen *not* show a stretched image. It's very... unsatisfying, but better than what I'd had, I think.

2017-04-05
Yesterday (not logged) I tried to put in a bootstrap modal lightbox (`ekko-lightbox`). It didn't work, and I couldn't figure out why, so I stripped it out.

Today I copied a demo modal from the bootstrap website. It didn't work. It didn't work, and it didn't work, and it didn't work, and then it worked. The only thing I did differently was punch the button a bunch. Cacheing? Problem with the CDN? I dunno. So, moving on, I guess.

<later>

I reinstalled `ekko-lightbox` and got it to work more-or-less. I think I prefer the `Magnific Popup` because I *won't* have to try to figure out how to style the modal pane (do I work with the lightbox's css? with bootstrap's? who is in control?)

I did test to see if I could separate images (using the "data-remote") construction. It seems to work ok.

===
2017-04-06
Apparently `magnific-popup` doesn't handle `srcset`. So trying a 3rd option: `lightGallery`

ANNNNDDDD... newp.

It doesn't seem to want to use `.class` as an identifier. I went back to `ekko-lightbox` --- it works as far as I can tell, just needs a lot of styling.

What I want is full-screen images on a nearly-black background, not enlarged. With navigation, titles and captions.

Making that happen is for another day. I'll keep the other branches until I pull the `lightbox` branch into `post-images`. You know, just in case.

===
2017-04-07
Styling the `ekko-lightbox`. It's... ok I guess? but I wish the `nav-overlay` was more accessible (in terms of figuring out how to style it). I know I can change the text used, but I can't quite figure out how to get it in line with the caption on the figure.

The basic style is done, so now I just need to update all the posts. I've decided that I will not resize images from elsewhere (like the UMMA images of Julia Cameron's work), but put them in an adhoc folder. Same for screen captures, since I don't really do them that much.

Before I can update the posts, I need to regenerate the large images. So next task is to decide on a naming scheme.

===
2017-04-08
Ok. Lightroom is only helpful up to a point. In this case, it *really really really* wants to put images in folders that **it** makes. And it won't let me say what characters I want it to strip out of filenames (_eg_ `()?!'&#`). But it easily will generate a hundred images in a few minutes, so that's nice. And it will remember what it published, so I don't have to.

I've tweaked the naming scheme to try to make it a smidge smaller, so I'm taking out some dashes and so forth.

Old style: `2015-08-03-barbara-tozier-square-orange-texture.jpg`
New style: `20150802-btozier-square-orange-texture.jpg`

(I don't know why the date changed. It's supposed to be the exif capture date.) I considered just having the year, but it's been helpful for me to see the whole date when I'm working with the files. So, I've saved 9 characters and will break any links that exist outside of my site. I'm actually kinda okay with that.

I put the images in a folder, then run an Automator Folder Action to "sanitize" the names. It is... not pretty, but it seems to work.


===
2017-04-09
This morning I did a better Automator Folder Action (including a `bash` script!). Still not 100% (I might end up with `--` in some filenames) but much more satisfactory.

Now, to edit all the posts. Still working in the `lightbox` branch, just in case...

<later>

I've been going through each post and moving images over into the proper place as I do it. I've found several images that were *not* managed by lightroom (mainly iphone ones) that I have since gone back and installed in my Master catalog.

There are 2 posts that are related to figuring out how to design the post/image structure for the old version of the site. I've moved them to `_drafts` and marked them to not publish (in the YAML). I think there is one "good" image that is not used anywhere else, so I may give it a post just because.

Then there is the one post that is related to the alt-pro gallery. I need to revisit this once I figure out the gallery structure.

===
2017-04-10
Finished recoding the posts images, with the exception of the gallery-related posts and the really out-of-date design posts. There are a few orphaned images, too. All of these have been moved to a folder called `_orphans`; the folder is excluded from Jekyll's runtime.

Made some new code for video embeds (I can't check locally because the server doesn't seem to want to serve it?). So after one more check I think `lightbox` is about ready to merge into `post-image`!

===
2017-04-11
Merged `lightbox` branch into `post-images` and deleted the other 2. I've decided to delay the `gallery` branch updates until after the `pages` branch because I want to step away from images for a couple of days.

The thing I just realized, though: I've made some changes to the site-wide view in addition to the posts. I think I will do the post text updats (like `blockquotes` styling, and then merge it into the `restructure` branch before I move back out into a `pages` branch. THEN `gallery`.)

<later>

Have done the blockquote styling, and updated the previous/next to read older/newer. Now to integrate into the `restructure` branch!

<later>

pull request successful! Heady times.

<later>

editing Pages (and accompanying nav links). Finding new stuff that's wrong all the time :/

Did the "About" page, and made a pass at the `post-index`. Changed the headers a bit so they're slightly more descriptive. "Buy" page needs a complete makeover w.r.t. Square Marketplace.

Still to do: gallery pages.

===
2017-04-12
Split gallery pages from the gallery index. Probably should have been that way originally, but anyway...

I wanted to edit the `buy` page to show stuff directly from Square Marketplace, but they changed their API to not allow embedded content :/ So now I'm not entirely sure what to do. The link is still on the page, so I suppose that is enough for now.

===
2017-04-16
A few days off and I'm a little lost. That's why I write these notes!

OK. `gallery` branch is here to make the galleries anew. I'm considering installing the `paginate-v2` gem/plugin (the one that is under active development), but that will require a separate branch because boy it looks complicated.

Anyway, off to `gallery`!

===
2017-04-23
Have finished `gallery` branch, made by restructuring the hell out of everything images. So now to move it into `restructure`. I think. I've lost track :(

Nope. Going to move it into `pages-update`. Success!

Now into `restructure`...
