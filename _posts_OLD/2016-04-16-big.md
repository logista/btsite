_Big_ is text. _Big_ is process. _Big_ is chaos. _Big_ is big.

As a photographer, I feel that there is a "right" size for every image, and it's not always "as big as possible". I started thinking about why artists would make large pieces. How could I make a piece that would be as big as I could possibly make it and still have it be "right" size?

Starting from a single medium format film negative, I scanned it at high resolution and brought it into Photoshop to color it. Then I loaded the resulting file into the open-source digital audio editor _Audacity_, and used its controls to "glitch" the image --- adding intentional but not entirely controllable noise and other effects.

After adding the text (and enhancing it with a scanned texture), I then used another open-source program (_ImageMagick_) to chop the file into twelve segments for printing (on metallic paper) and display.

_Big_ is the largest piece I've ever made. _Big_ is also not quite ready for its own gallery, because it really needs to be photographed _in situ_. I could put the digital files in, but I'm not sure that they represent the piece well. I'm hanging the piece soon, we'll see how it goes!
