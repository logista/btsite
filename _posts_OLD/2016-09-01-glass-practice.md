I mentioned in [Inspiration: Glass](/inspiration-glass) that I really enjoy photographing glass. Here are a few examples:

<figure class="image-s">

    <img src="/images/posts/s/2016-08-30-barbara-tozier-bottle.jpg">
  </a>

  </a>
    <span class="image-s-caption">Click image to see larger</span>
</figure>

These are simple settings, but it probably that it seems that way to me because I've photographed a lot of glass.[^ebay] I find that the objects are beautiful, and I try to share that.

Not that I intend to ever create in glass myself. I've worked around high-temperature furnaces (in a previous life) and it's not something I care to do more of. I do, however, appreciate people who do glass art. It's a fascinating medium.


[^ebay]: We have an [eBay store](http://www.ebay.com/sch/cornersbumped/m.html) where we sell collectibles and books. Most of the not-books are photographed by me, which is a great way to get familiar with product photography.
