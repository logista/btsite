I've reached the point in the semester that I'm putting the finishing touches on the prints and figuring out the displays and doing that last bit of homework. I have some posts coming later that go into more detail about what I've been up to for the past few weeks, but I wanted to share this image.

I have no memory of making this photo. I remember the context --- I was using my DSLR to test lens/exposure settings before using my 35mm film camera. I also remember the images before it and after it on the SD card. But for this image in particular, I have no idea what it is or why it exists.

In a way, that's what I try to do for all of my abstract images. Remove the context, yet make an interesting image despite the lack of information. This image, however, is putting me in the shoes of those viewers who want to know "what it is a picture of." Rather than being the smug person "in the know" I have as little idea as anyone else.

It's rather refreshing.
