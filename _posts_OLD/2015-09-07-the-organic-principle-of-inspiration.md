> Letting one's self go is but a half-principle.... The other half consists in getting one's self together again.

Gerald Stanley Lee wrote this in _The Lost Art of Reading_, 1902. (It's [available at Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26312).) He was talking about reading, about how as a reader you should let yourself go with the book where it leads.

Today I opened to this paragraph at random and was immediately inspired to incorporate it into a photographic piece---but I won't know until tomorrow whether or not anyone other than me knows that it's there.

That's almost the point for me: with my image and text project I want to explore various ways of bringing text into the camera, and once I have a method which works (not too much success yet, but it's early days), I will then do the "getting together" and make the cogent work. That's the plan, anyway.
