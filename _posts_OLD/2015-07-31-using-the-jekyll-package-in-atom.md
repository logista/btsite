<!-- Writing this in preparation for opening an issue on the `jekyll` package. -->

**tl;dr:**  `atom-runner` does something to my Atom environment that gets lost when it's taken away, and `jekyll` uses whatever it is. I don't think this is necessarily the fault of `jekyll` but I'm not sure where else to report it.

Caveat: I'm no coder.

- System: Mac OS X 10.10.4 [XCode not installed, though it may have been at one time]
- Atom: Version 1.0.2
- Jekyll: 1.0.0
- Atom-Runner: 2.4.1


1. For some reason I couldn't get `jekyll` to build my site.
2. I installed a script runner package (`atom-runner`) to check a few things from within Atom, and then `jekyll` worked.
3. So I uninstalled `atom-runner` and restarted Atom and `jekyll` stopped working.
4. Reinstalled `atom-runner` and `jekyll` works again
