### The New Gallery

<div markdown="1">
I have seen (and used) filters and processing on digital images to make them look more like film. With this project I poke a little fun at that habit, and at the same time I tease "film 4evah!" people by adding a digital-style effect to the image.

"Digital-style" means first creating an inkjet printed transparency of the text, then contact printing that onto lith (graphic arts) film to make a mask. I then take the mask and put it in the camera between the lens and the film plane, expose light through it, and then remove the mask before making the final exposure of the scene. This is why I call this work "In Camera" — everything you see in the images was created inside the camera box (with a few exceptions, like the toning color and the lith development).

The ten images inside the portfolio were created with two cameras, four kinds of medium format black and white film, two darkroom papers, two darkroom developing processes, and three types of chemical toners. The box is custom made; the cover image is an inkjet print of a digital image processed "to look like film."

Chemical and digital photography (and all mixtures of the two) are each "real" photography. They are part of a spectrum, not a dichotomy — there is room for everyone.
