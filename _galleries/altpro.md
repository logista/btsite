This project is a survey of Alternative Processes. AltPro encompasses a wide range of photographic methods, including historic processes such as cyanotype and gum bichromate; vintage processes such as instant film (aka Polaroid or Fuji) emulsion lifts and transfers, and lith printing; and modern processes such as digital negatives, inkjet transfers, and digital pinhole. There are as many AltPro methods as there are practitioners.
