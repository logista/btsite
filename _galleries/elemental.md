This project combines a Western idea of "mathematical beauty" with an Eastern idea of Process. Specifically, it blends Platonic Solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron) and the Wu Xing (five elements or phases -- wood, fire, earth, metal, water). Each of the Solids is made from a composite of several images that have been cut and folded into the 3D shape.
